        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>There are 300 million people with disabilities worldwide, of whom an estimated 180 million are visually impaired and 250 million are hearing impaired (WHO, 2003). In 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau (2003) reported that 19.3% of the U.S. population had a long-term illness or disability. As a result, website accessibility is a key priority and obligation for institutions of education.</p>
        <p>The general topic is the development of an educational platform and online community focused on common fungi. The platform aims to be inclusive and accessible, providing free educational resources to a diverse audience interested in learning about fungi. The goal is to dispel apprehensions surrounding various fungi and promote educational equality by offering comprehensive knowledge to a broad range of users, including minority groups.</p>
        <p>The information technology problem in this space is accessibility. The current learning websites that provide information about fungi are not meeting the standards of good accessibility. This includes considerations for users with visual impairments, hearing impairments, or other accessibility challenges.</p>
        <p>The current fungi learning websites have page organization, which is using headings, lists and consistent structure. It also has hypertext links which use text that makes sense when read out of context instead of “click here”. We are going to focus on other aspects of accessibility: images and animations, image maps, multimedia, tables.</p>
