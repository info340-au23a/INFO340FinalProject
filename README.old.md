# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

We use HTML and CSS to create this proposal, which includes the problem/data domain and app description. In the future, we will utilise JavaScript to create more detailed interactive features.
